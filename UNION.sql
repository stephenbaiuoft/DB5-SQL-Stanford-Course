/*
UNION allows you to stack one dataset on top of the other. 

ONLY puts *** DISTINCT VALUES ***

Put differently, UNION allows you to write two separate SELECT statements, 
and to have the results of one statement display in the same table as the results 
from the other statement.
*/

/*
1.  any rows in the appended table 
    that are exactly identical to rows in the first table are dropped

2. UNION ALL

3. Both 2 tables have same column order and same column definition!!!!!!
